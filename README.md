### feat

- **LLM Loader Core Implementation**: This task involves the development of the core code necessary to load LLMs. The goal is to enable the system to not only load LLMs but also to handle local LLM models efficiently, ensuring that the output can be retrieved seamlessly.

- **src/modules/llm/others**: Additional development is required within the `src/modules/llm` directory to support the full spectrum of functionalities anticipated for the LLM module. This may include the integration of utilities, interfaces, or sub-modules necessary to enhance the LLM loading capabilities and overall performance of the system.
